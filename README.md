# ios-dontpopme

u wanna pop me? lulz. ok hacker. show me what u got.

This is the exercise binary for my blog post "Guide to Reversing and Exploiting iOS binaries Part 2: ARM64 ROP Chains". 
ONLY download the binary "dontpopme". I have also uploaded the src if you are a lil evil cheating baby! 

Steps to install:
1. Download dontpopme (i have already compiled + signed it so it will work on ios)
2. SFTP over to your jailbroken device (i used 14.1 with unc0ver jailbreak)
3. move the binary to /var/mobile
4. chmod 777 dontpopme
5. run it ./dontpopme
6. have fun :)

peace out <3
